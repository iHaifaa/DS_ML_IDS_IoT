## Description
Basically, this repository is dedicated to creating a project to solve the portfolio builder exercises from the machine learning chapter provided by MISK in the following repository [misk-homl](https://github.com/iHaifaa/misk-homl). The aim of the project is to develop an intrusion detection system for IoT devices by comparing different machine learning algorithms and techniques, then selecting the best model which achieves the highest detection accuracy.

## Dataset 
The dataset used is [IoTID20](https://sites.google.com/view/iot-network-intrusion-dataset/home). Also, it is a new dataset and has not been deeply explored yet. Moreover, it consists of network flow data with 625783 observations (each is a whole network flow) and 85 features. It has five classes namely:
- Normal
- Mirai 
- DoS
- Scan 
- MITM ARP Spoofing

In the data folder, you will find the feature description. The whole dataset is not included in the data folder due to its size, but you can download it from the previous link.
