## Description
Basically, this repository is dedicated to create a project to solve the portfolio builder exercises from machine learning chapter provided by MISK in the following repository [link](https://github.com/iHaifaa/misk-homl). The aim of the project is to develop an intrusion detection system for IoT devices by comparing ditferent machine learning algorithms and techniques, then selecting the best model which achives the highest detection accuracy.

## Dataset 
The dataset used is IoTID20 [link](https://sites.google.com/view/iot-network-intrusion-dataset/home). It consists of newtork flow data with 625783 observations (each is a whole network flow) and 85 features. It has five classes namely; Normal, Mirai, DoS, Scan, and MITM ARP Spoofing. In addition, it is a new dataset and has not been deeply explored yet.
